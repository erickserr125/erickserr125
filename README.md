- Hi, I’m Erick Serrano, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of Nevada Las Vegas (UNLV) studying Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Physics
- I’m interested in Quantum Computing, Machine Learning, and Nuclear Physics; I have studied the former two extensively, and have completed research under faculty supervision.
- I'm currently learning about the Quantum Approximate Optimization algorithm and adiabatic quantum computing. I will be applying both toward the analog creation of a neural network.
- I’m looking to collaborate on quantum computing and machine learning projects! I would love to learn more from others and produce real-world applications!
- You can reach me through [my email](mailto:serrae4@unlv.nevada.edu) or through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erick-serrano-a45698140/)
